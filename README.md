# Consumer-Driven Contract tests

See README file in each folder

Background: https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#ContractTests

Source code: https://github.com/runarf/cdcPactJs

Steps:

- [] 1. The consuming team writes automated tests with all consumer expectations
- [] 2. They publish the tests for the providing team
- [] 3. The providing team runs the CDC tests continuously and keeps them green
- [] 4. Both teams talk to each other once the CDC tests break

## Should we use consumer driven contract tests

Pros:

- Less breaking changes.
-

Cons:

- New way of working
- New framework to use
- Causes more initial work
